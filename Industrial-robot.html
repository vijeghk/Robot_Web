            Vertical articulated robots are well-suited for tasks that involve
            working on curved surfaces or moving along circular paths. They
            feature a vertical column for lifting and an arm that rotates
            around the column, both controlled independently to easily create
            helical paths. This type of robot structure is similar to the
            human shoulder joint, and by leveraging this biomimetic design,
            vertical articulated robots can effortlessly perform precise
            and complex tasks. They are highly popular in a variety of
            tasks such as assembly, welding, and painting.

            Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arms, commonly known as SCARA
            robots, typically have four degrees of freedom: the base can rotate
            around a vertical axis, the arm can move up and down along a vertical
            column, and the end effector, which can rotate around its own axis,
            can move horizontally. This design allows for quick and precise
            movements confined to a single horizontal plane, making them widely
            popular in the assembly of small precision parts and product packaging.

            Gantry Robots, also known as gantry robots or Cartesian coordinate robots,
            typically consist of three mutually perpendicular linear motion axes
            (X, Y, Z), capable of achieving precise positioning and operation,
            playing a crucial role in scenarios that require high-precision
            operations. Compared to other types of robots, gantry robots can
            also operate in a larger working area. Therefore, engineers usually
            design them with higher load capacity, making them more suitable
            for handling large items. In addition, due to their simple structure,
            gantry robots also have strong flexibility and low maintenance
            costs, allowing them to be easily integrated into production lines.
            In fields such as welding, assembly, inspection, and painting,
            there are always the figures of gantry robots.

            Cylindrical robots are mechanically simple, featuring a rotating base
            for rotation and two linear axes for height control and arm extension.
            With the addition of the appropriate end-of-arm tooling, they can be
            a powerful and compact robot. Due to their construction, they do not
            have complex movements like six-axis robots, nor do they possess the
            high-speed capabilities to compete with delta robots. Simple tasks
            that do not require high speed, payload, or joint motion, such as
            unloading 3D printed materials, are well-suited for cylindrical
            robots. Additionally, cylindrical robots are compact and have
            a slender mechanical structure, making them necessary for
            applications that require a compact solution.

            Polar coordinate robots have a motion system composed of three
            basic degrees of freedom: one rotation (θ) and two oscillations
            (ρ and φ). The base of these robots is fixed, and the arm rotates
            around a central axis, followed by further motion through one or
            two additional rotary joints. Their workspace is typically
            spherical, which gives them an advantage when dealing with
            tasks that require coverage in all directions. They are
            particularly popular in machine tool operations and assembly
            tasks.

            Delta robots, also known as spider robots or parallel robots, are
            high-speed mechanical arms with three degrees of freedom, composed
            of three parallel arms and a central moving platform. Delta robots
            are renowned in the industrial field for their ability to quickly
            perform small, precise movements. They can handle more than
            100 parts per minute, picking, placing, and sorting them at
            a speed much faster than what manual labor processes can execute.
            They are highly suitable for carrying out repetitive tasks
            very efficiently at a highly consistent pace. They are popular
            in the fields of automated boxing operations and high-precision
            assembly processes.

            cobots have higher safety standards, often equipped with sensors

            thus avoiding injury to workers. They are also easier to program,
            more user-friendly, and more flexible, capable of quickly adapting
            to changing work demands and environments. They are widely used
            in a variety of fields and have a significant market demand.
