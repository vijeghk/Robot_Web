            <p>
                Robot is an automated machine that possesses certain intelligent
                capabilities similar to humans or living organisms. And it is a highly
                flexible automated machine.

                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>The history of robots dates back a long time. In 1498, Leonardo da
                    Vinci designed a clockwork knight, marking the emergence of the early
                    prototype of human-like machines. In 1920, the Czech writer Karel
                    ÄŒapek published the science fiction play "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal
                    Robots), which is considered the origin of the term "robot."</p>

                <h3>First-Generation Robots: Teleoperated Robots</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 1947, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States
                        developed the world's first teleoperated robot for handling
                        nuclear materials. This was a remote-controlled device designed
                        to perform tasks in environments too dangerous for human workers.
                    </li>
                    <li>In 1962, the United States developed the Programmable Universal
                        Machine for Assembly (PUMA), a general-purpose teach-and-repeat
                        robot. These robots operate by following pre-programmed paths
                        and actions stored in their memory. They are often used in
                        repetitive tasks such as spot welding in the automotive industry,
                        where the robot can be taught the task once and then repeat it
                        indefinitely.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Second-Generation Robots: Sensory Robots</h3>
                <p>First-generation robots lack perception of their environment, meaning
                    they cannot detect changes or make decisions based on feedback.
                    To address this, sensory robots were developed in the late 1970s.
                    These robots are equipped with sensors that give them a sense of
                    touch, force, slip, vision, and hearing, allowing them to perceive
                    and recognize the shape, size, and color of workpieces. This enables
                    them to perform tasks with more autonomy and adapt to varying
                    conditions.

            <h2>Odes to Modern Robotics</h2>
            <p class="h2">
                The modern robots is the third-generation robots, also known as intelligent
                robots,and have been invented since the 1990s. These robots are equipped
                with a variety of sensors, capable of complex logical reasoning, judgment,
                and decision-making. They can autonomously determine their own actions
                in response to changes in internal states and external environments.
                These robots represent a new era of robotics technology, as they can
                not only perform preset tasks but also adapt to environmental changes,
                making self-adjustments and optimizations.

                    <h3>Embodied Intelligence and Vertical Large Model</h3>
                    <p>
                        Combining large models with embodied intelligence, along with
                        the joint analysis of multimodal data such as text, images, and
                        audio, more powerful and intelligent robotic systems can be created.
                        This enables robots to better handle various situations and complex
                        environments, and is expected to lead to well-scaled applications.
