              Both AUVs and UAVs are pilotless robots capable of autonomous
              operation. The origin of UAVs can be traced back to the early
              20th century, with the first true drone, the "Queen Bee," invented
              in 1935. The development of AUV technology came relatively later,
              but in recent years, with the increasing demand for ocean
              exploration, the application of AUVs has gradually increased.
              They play an important role in reconnaissance, agricultural
              monitoring, environmental monitoring, logistics delivery,
              disaster relief, and data collection.

              patient recovery. These robots have a wide range of clinical
              applications in surgery. Their emergence allows surgeons to
              manipulate the machine away from the operating table, which
              is completely different from the traditional concept of
              surgery. They are truly revolutionary surgical tools in
              the field of minimally invasive surgery worldwide.

              Rehabilitation robots are high-tech devices used in the field
              of rehabilitation medicine. They combine robotic technology
              with medical techniques to help patients recover motor functions
              and assist individuals with motor functional disorders caused
              by diseases or injuries in their rehabilitation training.
              Rehabilitation robots replace therapists in conducting
              high-intensity, repetitive training, allowing therapists to
              focus more on improving treatment plans. Moreover, they can
              collect data through sensors, assist therapists, and enhance
              the effectiveness of the treatment. Rehabilitation robots

              They utilize advanced sensors, control systems, and artificial intelligence technology to perform various
              tasks in agricultural production, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of agriculture. These
              robots are mainly used in the harvesting phase, but they can also carry out tasks such as soil
              exploration, weed control, plant seeding, and environmental monitoring.Equipped with a variety of tools,
              they can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, reducing human workload, decreasing labor costs, and
              agricultural labor time, and enhancing work efficiency.The power management module of agricultural robots
              ensures their endurance in the field. The module design takes into account the high energy consumption
              characteristics of agricultural robots working outdoors, and common structures include Battery Management
              Systems (BMS), solar power systems, and energy recovery devices.In terms of application scenarios,
              agricultural robots are diverse and can adapt to the needs of different crops and operations. The main
              application scenarios include seeding and fertilization, plant protection and weeding, harvesting and
              picking, soil and crop monitoring, greenhouse management and environmental control, and multi-robot
